# Marlowe-FS

F# Bindings for [Marlowe-RS] (https://github.com/OlofBlomqvist/marlowe-rs)

*Based on marlowe-rs v0.2.0 via WASI*

**This is an extremely unstable repository, don't try to use it for anything important**

Project goals:

- Provide all features that Marlowe_Lang ([Marlowe-RS](https://github.com/OlofBlomqvist/marlowe-rs)) does.
- Allow for designing Marlowe contracts in F#
- Provide base layer for equivalent C# Marlowe SDK
